	Example 1:
	automatic model fetching of an api
-->
<div data-xng-view="views/my/template.tpl.html"
	 data-xng-model="api/my/model.json">

	<!--
		the return value of the route "api/my/model.json" is
		assigned as "$model" variable to the content of the
		loaded view "views/my/template.tpl.html"
	-->
</div>


<!--
	Example 2:
	direct model assignment in a loaded template via javascript

	consider this as the content of "views/my/template.tpl.html"
	and the "api/my/model.json" is returning the sample model object

-->
<div data-xng-view="my/inner/template.tpl.html"
	 data-xng-model="{{\ _.xng.assign($model.firstname + ' ' + $model.lastname) }}">

	<!--
		the value of the $model variable available in the
		"my/inner/template.tpl.html" will be "Matthias Schmid" because
		of the assignment above at line nr. 30

	-->
</div>
